# SF2942-calculator-programs-for-TI-84

This repository contains TI-84 calculator programs for the course **SF2942 HT24 Portfolio Theory and Risk Management** at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**. The programs are (no longer) highly aligned to the exam questions and could save a lot of time for you in your exam. All programs are my original work. 

Use the programs on your own risk, the author takes no resonsibility.
